Requirements
------------
To run this project Numpy is required.
I simply used Anaconda to install this.
I'm quite new to Python, but I think Numpy is the only non-default package I used.

Greasemonkey is also required, not only for logging, but also for showing the suggestions.

Installation & running
----------------------
Note: the greasemonkey script was changed from the original one given to use,
but installation is exactly the same.

1. Install the updated urlStreamHandler.user.js in Greasemonkey
2. Run urlStreamHandler.py using Python3
3. It will start learning (see settings to change data)
4. Start surfing and check the bottom right for suggestions

Running test
------------
To run tests, simply run Tester.py rather than urlStreamHandler.py.
Change the main method to run different tests.
(Look out, tests other than the per_user tests are very slow.)

Settings
--------
To select a different set of csv files to initially learn from, change line 107 in urlStreamHandler.py

All hyperparameters, including their explanation, can be found in Guesser.py (first lines of the class)

Uninstalling / deactivating
---------------------------
Killing the urlStreamHandler.py script stops saving urls to file.

To deactivate or uninstall the Greasemonkey script:

- Go to `tools>Greasemonkey>Manage User Scripts ...` or click the Greasemonkey
  icon in the toolbar.
- Click on 'Disable' or 'Remove'.
